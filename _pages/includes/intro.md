Hi! I am an algorithm engineer at Ant Group beginning from 2022. 
Prior to Ant Group, I got my M.S degree in <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/">Peking University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href="http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/GSAI_FACULTY/28026f7425324f61991c70d279372d13.htm">Rui Yan</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/zhaodongyan/en/">Dongyan Zhao</a>.


My research interest includes retrieval for searching, summarization, text generation and LLM for science. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation or have any questions for me, please feel free to email me at [limingzhe.lmz@antgroup.com](mailto:limingzhe.lmz@antgroup.com).
